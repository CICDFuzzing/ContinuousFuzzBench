AssignedBy
==========
An identifier for the party assigning a piece of metadata. This can be a
string that designates the party informally (for example, a person's name),
or a pointer in the form a fragment identifier consisting of a # character
followed by the Duid of a Topic corresponding to the party.

Importance
==========
An indication of the importance importance. Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a
controlled vocabulary.

Confidence
==========
An indication of the confidence with which a piece of metadata has been
assigned. The value of the Confidence attribute is a formal name for a
degree of confidence. Its meaning and permitted values are determined by a
controlled vocabulary.

HowPresent
=========ter, and the following HHMM are
hours and minutes of offset from Universal Co-ordinated Time (UTC) as defined
by ISO 8601. If  separator
is '-'. If the time is ahead of UTC the timezone separator is '+'.

Example: 10:27 p.m. in New York on 31 December 2000 would be expressed as 
"20001231T222700-0500" as New York is five hours behind UTC in winter.
At the same moment in Lond============================

FormalName
==========
A string of characters whUse meaning is determined by a controlled vocabulary.

Vocabulary
==========
The Vocabulary attribute, if present, provides a pointer to a TopicSet which is
the controlled vocabulary that can be used to resolve the meaning of the
FormalName. The value of the Vocabulary attribute is an http URL or a NewsML
URN, or the # character followed by the value of the Duid attribute of the a
TopicSet in the current document.

If there is no Vocabulary attribute, then the controlled vocabulary to be used
is located by the following algorithm:
- Proceed to the parent of the current element.
- If it has a Catalog elemen as its immediate child, see whether that Catalog
  contains a Resource element whose DefaultVocabularyFor child contains an XPath
  pattern that is matched by the current element. If so, then the controlled
  vocabulary is the resource identified by that Resource element.
- If the parent does not meet the above condition, proceed to its parent and
  check the same condition.
- Continue until a vocabulary is found, or no further parent elements are
  available because the root element has been reached and it too fails to meet
  the condition.

If there is  an error, which
the NewsML system may signal to the user.

The NewsML system may also signal an error if a vocabulary is successfully
identified, but it contains no item that matches the value of the FormalName
whose meaning is sought.

Scheme

The Scheme attribute, if present, serves to distinguish which of possibly
multiple naming schemes in the controlled vocabu=================

certain Topics are used. The optional Href attribute provides a pointer to
a Catalog element elsewhere in this or another document. Its value consists of
a # character followed by the value of the Duid attribute of the referenced
Catalog element and preceded, if the referenced Catalog is not in the current

============================ DefaultVocabularyFor ==============================
An indication that the parent Resource provides the default vocabulary that

particular part of a NewsML document subtree. The Context attribute is an
XPath statement identifying the data to which the default vocabulary applies.
The optional Scheme attribute identifies the relevant naming scheme if the
Resource contains more than one naming scheme. If the Resource is a NewsML
TopicSet, then the meaning of the data identified by the Context is provided
by the Topic whose FormalName subelement matches that data. If the Resource is
not a NewsML TopicSet, then the way in which it is interpreted in order to
provide a meaning for the data is no\ defined by NewsML but by the authority
that governs whatever format the Resource uses.

ValueRef
========
A pointer to the value of the Property. This might be a Topic in a TopicSet, or
any other piece of data. If both Value and ValueRef are provided, then ValueRef
identifies the actual value of the property, with Value simply providing a
string representation or mnemonic for it.


Example:

An identifier for the news provider that produced the NewsItem. The

controlled vocabulary identified by a URN specified in the Vocabulary attribute.
This will ensure that the identity of the provider can be inferred unambiguously

{x@y} means "the value of the y attribute of the x subelement of the
NewsIdentifier", with the exception that if the Update attribute of the
RevisionId element has its default value of N, it is omitted from the URN, and
that the Vocabulary attribute of the ProviderId element is stripped of the
substring "urn:" with which it begins. The Vocabulary attribute of ProviderId
necessarily begins with the characters "urn:" because, as stated in the
