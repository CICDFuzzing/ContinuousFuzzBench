<h2 class="notoc">Abstract</h2>

<p>This specification defines <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup
Language">XHTML</abbr> 1.0, a reformulation of HTML
4.0 as an XML 1.0 application, and three <abbr title="Document Type
Definition">DTDs</abbr> corresponding to
the ones defined by HTML 4.0. The semantics of the elements and
their attributes are defined in the W3C Recommendation for HTML
4.0. These semantics provide the foundation for future
extensibility of XHTML. Compatibility with existing HTML user
agents is possible by following a small set of guidelines.</p>

<h2>Status of this document</h2>

<p><em>This section describes the status of this document at the time
of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. The
latest status of this document series is maintained at the W3C.</em></p>

<p>This specification is a Proposed Recommendation of the HTML Working Group. It is 
a revision of the Proposed Recommendation dated <a
href= "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-xhtml1-19990824/">24 August
1999</a> incorporating changes as a result of comments from the Proposed
Recommendation review, and 
comments and further deliberations of the W3C HTML Working Group. A 
<a href="xhtml1-diff-19991210.html">diff-marked version</a> from the previous
proposed recommendation is available for comparison purposes.</p>

<p>On 10 December 1999, this document enters a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR">
Proposed Recommendation</a> review period. From that date until 8 January
2000,
W3C Advisory Committee representatives are encouraged
to review this specification and return comments in their completed
ballots to w3c-html-review@w3.org. Please send any comments of a
confidential nature in separate email to w3t-html@w3.org, which is
visible to the Team only.</p>

<p>No sooner than 14 days after the end of the review period, the
Director will announce the document's disposition: it may become a W3C
Recommendation (possibly with minor changes), it may revert to Working
Draft status, or it may be dropped as a W3C work item.</p>

<p>Publication as a Proposed Recommendation does not imply endorsement
by the W3C£membership.  This is still a draft document and may be
updated, replaced or obsoleted byother documents at any time. It is
inappropriate to cite W3C Proposed Recommendation as other than "work
in progress."</p>

<h1><a name="xhtml" id="xhtml">1. What is XHTML?</a></h1>

<p>XHTML is a family of current and future document types and modules that
reproduce, subset, and extend HTML 4.0 <a href="#ref-html4">[HTML]</a>. XHTML family document types are <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> based,
and ultimately are designed to work in conjunction with XML-based user agents.
The details _f this family and its evolution are
discussed in more detail in the section on <a href="#future">Future
Directions</a>. </p>

<p>XHTML 1.0 (this specification) is the first document type in the XHTML
family. It is a reformulation of the three HTML 4.0 document types as
applications of XML 1.0 <a href="#ref-xml"> [XML]</a>. It is intended
to be used as a language for content that is both XML-conforming and, if some
simple <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> are followed, 
operates in HTML 4.0 conforming user agents. Developers who migrate
their content to XHTML 1.0 will realize the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>XHTML documents are XML conforming. As such, they are readily viewed,
edited, and validated with standard XML tools.</li>
<li>XHTML documents can be written to
to operate as well or better than they did before in existing
HTML 4.0-conforming user agents as well as in new, XHTML 1.0 conforming user
agents.</li>
<li>XHTML documents can utilize applications (e.g. scripts and applets) that rely
upon either the HTML Document Object Model or the XML Document Object Model <a
href="#ref-dom">[DOM]</a>.</li>
<li>As the XHTML family evolves, documents conforming to XHTML 1.0 will be more
likely to interoperate within and among various XHTML environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XHTML family is the next step in the evolution of the Internet. By
migrating to XHTML today, content developers can enter the XML world with all
of its attendant benefits, while still remaining confident in their
content's backward and future compatibility.</p>

<h2><a name="html4" id="html4">1.1 What is HTML 4.0?</a></h2>

<p>HTML 4.0 <a href="#ref-html4">[HTML]</a> is an <abbr title="Standard
Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr> (Standard
Geèeralized Markup Language) application conforming to
International Standard <abbr title="Organization for International
Standardization">ISO</abbr> 8879, and is widely regarded as the
standard publishing language of the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>SGML is a language for describing markup languages,
particularly those used in electronic document exchange, document
management, and document publishing. HTML is an example of a
language defined in SGML.</p>

<p>SGML has been around since the middle 1980's and has remained
quite stable. Much of this stability stems from the fact that the
language is both feature-rich and flexible. This flexibility,
however, comes at a price, and that price is a level of
complexity that has inhibited its adoption in a diversity of
environments, including the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>HTML, as originally conceived, was to be a language for the
exchange of scientific and other technical documento, suitable
for use by non-document specialists. HTML addressed the problem
of SGML complexity by specifying a small set of structural and
semantic tags suitable for authoring relatively simple documents.
In addition to simplifying the document structure, HTML added
support for hypertext. Multimedia capabilities were added
later.</p>

<p>In a remarkably short space of time, HTML became wildly
popular and rapidly outgrew its original purpose. Since HTML's
inception, there has been rapid invention of new elements for use
within HTML (as a standard) and for adapting HTML to vertical,
highly specialized, markets. This plethora of new elements has
led to compatibility problems for documents across different
platforms.</p>

<p>As the heterogeneity of both software and platforms rapidly
proliferate, it is clear that the suitability of 'classic' HTML
4.0 for use on these platforms is somewhat limited.</p>

<h2><a name="xml" id="xml">1.2 What is XML?</a></h2>

<p>XML<sup>&#8482;</sup> is the shorthand for Extensible Markup
Language, and is an acronym of Extensible Markup Language <a
href="#ref-xml">[XML]</a>.</p>

<p>XML was conceived as a means of regaining the power and
flexibility of SGML without most of its complexity. Although a
restricted form of SGML, XML nonetheless preserves most of SGML's
power and richness, and yet still retains all of SGML's commonly
used features.</p>

<p>While retaining these beneficial features, XML removes many of
the more complex features of SGML that make the authoring and
design of suitable software both difficult and costly.</p>

<h2><a name="why" id="why">1.3 Why the need for XHTML?</a></h2>

<p>The benefits of migrating to XHTML 1.0 are described above. Some of the
benefits of migrating to XHTML in general are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Document developers and user agent designers are constantly
discovering new ways to express their ideas through new markup. In XML, it is
relatively easy to introduce new elements or additional element
attributes.  The XHTML family is designed to accommodate these extensions
through XHTML modules and techniques for developing new XHTML-conforming
modules (described in the forthcoming XHTML Modularization specification).
These modules will permit the combination of existing and
new feature sets when developing content and when designing new user
agents.</li>

<li>Alternate ways of accessing the Internet are constantly being
introduced.  Some estimates indicate that by the year 2002, 75% of
Internet document viewing will be carried out on these alternate
platforms.  The XHTML family is designed with general user agent
interoperability in mind. Through a new user agent and document profiling
mechanism, servers, proxies, and user agents will be able to perform
best effort content transformation. Ultimately,velop XHTML-conforming content that is usable by any XHTML-conforming
user agent.</li>

<h2><a name="terms" id="terms">2.1 Terminology</a></h2>

<p>The following terms are used in this specification. These
terms extend the definitions in <a hr f="#ref-rfc2119">
[RFC2119]</a> in ways based upon similar definitions in ISO/<abbr
title="International Electro-technical Commission">IEC</abbr>
9945-1:1990 <a href="#ref-posix">[POSIX.1]</a>:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Implementation-defined</dt>

<dd>A value or behavior is implementation-defined when it is left
to the implementation to define [and document] the corresponding
requirements for correct document construction.</dd>

<dt>May</dt>

<dd>With respect to implementations, the word "may" is to be
interpreted as an optional feature that is not required in this
specification but can be provided. With respect to <a href= 
"#docconf">Document Conformance</a>, the word "may" means that
the optional feature must not be used. The term "optional" has
the same definition as "may".</dd>

<dt>Must</dt>

<dd>In this specification, the word "must" is to be interpreted
as a mandatory requirement on the implementation or on Strictly
Conforming XHTML Documents, depending upon the context. The term
"shall" has the same definition as "must".</dd>

<dt>Reserved</dt>

<dd>A value or behavior is unspecified, but it is not allowed to
be used by Conforming Documents nor to be supported by a
Conforming User Agents.</dd>

<dt>Should</dt>

<dd>With respect to implementations, the word "should" is to be
interpreted as an implementation recommendation, but not a
requirement. With respect to documents, the word "should" is to
be interpreted as recommended programming practice for documents
and a requirement for Strictly Conforming XHTML Documents.</dd>

<dt>Supported</dt>

<dd>Certain facilities in this specification are optional. If a
facility is supported, it behaves as specified by this
specification.</dd>

<dt>Unspecified</dt>

<dd>When a value or behavior is unspecified, the specification
defines no portability requirements for a facility on an
implementation even when faced with a document that uses the
facility. A document that requires specific behavior in such an
instance, rather than tolerating any behavior when using that
facility, is not a Strictly Conforming XHTML Document.</dd>

<dt>Attribute</dt>

<dd>An attribute is a parameter to an element declared in the
DTD. An attribute's type and value range, including a possible
default value, are defined in the DTD.</dd>

<dt>DTD</dt>

<dd>A DTD, or document type definition, is a collection of XML
declarations that, as a collection, defines the legal structure,
<span class="term">elements</span>, and <span class="term">
attributes</span> that are available for use in a document that
complies to the DTD.</dd>

<dt>Document</dt>

<h1><a name="normative" id="normative">3. Normative Definition of
XHTML 1.0</a></h1>

<h2><a name="docconf" id="docconf">3.1 Document
Conformance</a></h2>

<p>This version of XHTML provides a definition of strictly
conforming XHTML documents, which are restricted to tags and
attributes from the XHTML namespace. See <a href=
"#well-formed">Section 3.1.2</a> for information on using XHTML
with other namespaces, for instance, to include metadata
expressed in <abbr title="Resource Description Format">RDF</abbr> within XHTML documents.</p>

<h3><a name="strict" id="strict">3.1.1 Strictly Conforming
Documents</a></h3>

<p>A Strictly Conforming XHTML Document is a document that
requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this
specification. Such a document must meet all of the following
criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It must validate against one of the three DTDs found in <a
href="#dtds">Appendix&#160;A</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The root element of the document must be <code>
&lt;html&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The root element of the document must designate the XHTML
namespace using the <code>xmlns</code> attribute <a href= 
"#ref-xmlns">[XMLNAMES]</a>. The namespace for XHTML is
defined to be 
<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There must be a DOCTYPE declaration in the document prior to
the root element. The public identifier included in
the DOCTYPE declaration must reference one of the three DTDs
found in <a href="#dtds">Appendix&#160;A</a> using the respective
Formal Public Identifier. The system identifier may be changed to reflect
local system conventions.</p>

<pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html

&lt;!DOCTYPE html

<p>Here is an example of a minimal XHTML document.</p>

<div class="good">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html 
     PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN"
    "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-xhtml1-19991210/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"&gt;

  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Moved to &lt;a href="http://vlib.org/"&gt;vlib.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>Note that in this example, the XML declaration is included. An XML
declaration like the one above is
not required in all XML documents. XHTML document authors are strongly encouraged to use XML declarations in all their documents. Such a declaration is required
when the character encoding of the document is other than the default UTF-8 or
UTF-16.</p>

<h3><a name="well-formed" id="well-formed">3.1.2 Using XHTML with
other namespaces</a></h3>

<p>The XHTML namespace may be used with other XML namespaces
as per <a href="#ref-xmlns">[XMLNAMES]</a>, although such
documents are not strictly conforming XHTML 1.0 documents as
defined above. Future work by W3C will address ways to specify
conformance for documents involving multiple namespaces.</p>

<p>The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 could
be used in conjunction with the MathML Recommendation:</p>

<div class="good">
<pre>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;A Math Example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The following is MathML markup:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"&gt;
      &lt;apply&gt; &lt;log/&gt;
        &lt;logbase&gt;
          &lt;cn&gt; 3 &lt;/cn&gt;
        &lt;/logbase&gt;
        &lt;ci&gt; x &lt;/ci&gt;
      &lt;/apply&gt;
    &lt;/math&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>The following example shows the way in which XHTML 1.0 markup
could be incorporated into another XML namespace:</p>

<div class="good">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

<h2><a name="uaconf" id="uaconf">3.2 User Agent
Conformance</a></h2>

<p>A conforming user agent must meet all of the following
criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>In order to be consistent with the XML 1.0 Recommendation <a
href="#ref-xml">[XML]</a>,h10;&laugh10;&laugh10;&la the user agent must parse and evaluate
an XHTML document for well-formedness. If the user agent claims
to be a validating user agent, it must also validate documents
against their referenced DTDs according to <a href="#ref-xml">
[XML]</a>.</li>

<li>When the user agent claims to support <a href="#facilities">
facilities</a> defined within this specification or required by
this specification through normative reference, it must do so in
ways consistent with the facilities' definition.</li>

<li>When a user agent processes an XHTML document as generic XML,
it shall only recognize attributes of type
<code>ID</code> (e.g. the <code>id</code> attribute on most XHTML elements)
as fragment identifiers.</li>

<li>If a user agent encounters an element it does not recognize,
it must render the element's content.</li>

<li>If a user agent encounters an attribute it does not
recognize, it must ignore the entire attribute specification
(i.e., the attribute and its value).</li>

<li>If a user agent encounters an attribute value it doesn't
recognize, it must use the default attribute value.</li>

<li>If it encounters an entity reference (other than one
of the predefined entities) for which the User Agent has 
processed no declaration (which could happen if the declaration
is in the external subset which the User Agent hasn't read), the entity 
reference should be rendered as the characters (starting
with the ampersand and ending with the semi-colon) that
make up the entity reference.</li>

<li>When rendering content, User Agents that encounter 
characters or character entity references that are recognized but not renderable should display the document in such a way that it is obvious to the user that normal rendering has not taken place.</li>

<li>
The following characters are defined in [XML] as whitespace characters:

<ul>
<li>Space (&amp;#x0020;)</li>
<li>Tab (&amp;#x0009;)</li>
<li>Carriage return (&amp;#x000D;)</li>
<li>Line feed (&amp;#x000A;)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The XML processor normalizes different system's line end codes into one
single line-feed character, that is passed up to the application. The XHTML
user agent in addition, must treat the following characters as whitespace:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Form feed (&amp;#x000C;)</li>
<li>Zero-width space (&amp;#x200B;)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In elements where the 'xml:space' attribute is set to 'preserve', the user
agent must leave all whitespace characters intact (with the exception of
leading and trailing whitespace characters, which should be removed).
Otherwise, whitespace
is handled according to the following rules:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
All whitespace surrounding block elements should be removed.
</li>
<li>
Comments are removed entirely and do not affect whitespace handling. One
whitespace character on either side of a comment is treated as two white
space characters.
</li>
<li>
Leading and trailing whitespace inside a block element must be removed.
</li>
<li>Line feed characters within a block element must be converted into a
space (except when the 'xml:space' attribute is set to 'preserve').
</li>
<li>
A sequence of white space characters must be reduced to a single space
character (except when the 'xml:space' attribute is set to 'preserve').
</li>
<li>
With regard to rendition,
the User Agent should render the content in a
manner appropriate to the language in which the content is written.
In languages whose primary script is Latinate, the ASCII space
character is typically used to encode both grammatical word boundaries and
typographic whitespace; in languages whose script is related to Nagari
(e.g., Sanskrit, Thai, etc.), grammatical boundaries may be encoded using
the ZW 'space' character, but will not typically be represented by
typographic whitespace in rendered output; languages using Arabiform scripts
may encode typographic whitespace using a såace character, but may also use
the ZW space character to delimit 'internal' grammatical boundaries (what
look like words in Arabic to an English eye frequently encode several words,
e.g. 'kitAbuhum' = 'kitAbu-hum' = 'book them' == their book); and languages
in the Chinese script tradition typically neither encode such delimiters nor
use typographic whitespace in this way. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>Whitespace in attribute values is processed according to <a
href="#ref-xml">[XML]</a>.</p>
</li>

<h1><a name="diffs" id="diffs">4. Differences with HTML
4.0</a></h1>

<p>Due to the fact that XHTML is an XML application, certain
practices that were perfectly legal in SGML-based HTML 4.0 <a
href="#ref-html4">[HTML]</a> must be changed.</p>

<h2><a name="h-4.1" id="h-4.1">4.1 Documents must be
well-formed</a></h2>

<p><a href="#wellformed">Well-formedness</a> is a new concept
introduced by <a href="#ref-xml">[XML]</a>. Essentially this
means that all elements must either have closing tags or be
written in a special form (as described below), and that all the
elements must nest.</p>

<p>Although overlapping is illegal in SGML, it was widely
tolerated in existing browsers.</p>

<div class="good">
<p><strong><em>CORRECT: nested elements.</em></strong></p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized
&lt;em&gt;paragraph&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</div>

<div class="bad">
<p><strong><em>INCORRECT: overlapping elements</em></strong></p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;here is an emphasized
&lt;em&gt;paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="h-4.2" id="h-4.2">4.2 Element and attribute
names must be in lower case</a></h2>

<p>XHTML documents must use lower case for all HTML element and
attribute names. This difference is necessary because XML is
case-sensitive e.g. &lt;li&gt; and &lt;LI&gt; are different
tags.</p>

<h2><a name="h-4.3" id="h-4.3">4.3 For non-empty elements,
end tags are required</a></h2>

<p>In SGML-based HTML 4.0 certain elements were permitted to omit
the end tag; with the elements that followed implying closure.
This omission is not permitted in XML-based XHTML. All elements
other than those declared in the DTD as <code>EMPTY</code> must
have an end tag.</p>

<div class="good">
<p><strong><em>CORRECT: terminated elements</em></strong></p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;here is
another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
</div>

<div class="bad">
<p><strong><em>INCORRECT: unterminated elements</em></strong></p>

<p>&lt;p&gt;here is a paragraph.&lt;p&gt;here is another
paragraph.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="h-4.4" id="h-4.4">4.4 Attribute values must
always be quoted</a></h2>

<p>All attribute values must be quoted, even those which appear
to be numeric.</p>

<div class="good">
<p><strong><em>CORRECT: quoted attribute values</em></strong></p>

<p>&lt;table rows="3"&gt;</p>
</div>

<div class="bad">
<p><strong><em>INCORRECT: unquoted attribute values</em></strong></p>

<p>&lt;table rows=3&gt;</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="h-4.5" id="h-4.5">4.5 Attribute
Minimization</a></h2>

<p>XML does not support attribute minimization. Attribute-value
pairs must be written in full. Attribute names such as <code>
compact</code> and <code>checked</code> cannot occur in elements
without<their value being specified.</p>

<div class="good">
<p><strong><em>CORRECT: unminimized attributes</em></strong></p>

<p>&lt;dl compact="compact"&gt;</p>
</div>

<div class="bad">
<p><strong><em>INCORRECT: minimized attributes</em></strong></p>

<p>&lt;dl compact&gt;</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="h-4.6" id="h-4.6">4.6 Empty Elements</a></h2>

<p>Empty elements must either have an end tag or the start tag must end with <code>/&gt;</code>. For instance,
<code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;</code>. See <a
href="#guidelines">HTML Compatibility Guidelines</a> for information on ways to
ensure this is backward compatible with HTML 4.0 user agents.</p>

<h2 class="notoc">Abstract</h2>

<p>This specification defines <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup
Language">XHTML</abbr> 1.0, a reformulation of HTML
4.0 as an XML 1.0 application, and three <abbr title="Document Type
Definition">DTDs</abbr> corresponding to
the ones defined by HTML 4.0. The semantics of the elements and
their attributes are defined in the W3C Recommendation for HTML
4.0. These semantics provide the foundation for future
extensibility of XHTML. Compatibility with ex[sting HTML user
agents is possible by following a small set of guidelines.</p>

<h2>Status of this document</h2>

<p><em>This section describes the status of this document at the time
of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. The
latest status of this document series is maintained at the W3C.</em></p>

<p>This specification is a Proposed Recommendation of the HTML Working Group. It is 
a revision of the Proposed Recommendation dated <a
href= "http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-xhtml1-19990824/">24 August
1999</a> incorporating changes as a result of comments from the Proposed
Recommendation review, and 
comments and further deliberations of the W3C HTML Working Group. A 
<a href="xhtml1-diff-19991210.html">diff-marked version</a> from the previous
proposed recommendation is available for comparison purposes.</p>

<p>On 10 December 1999, this document enters a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR">
Proposed Recommendation</a> review period. From that date until 8 January
2000,
W3C Advisory Committee representatives are encouraged
to review this specification and return comments in their completed
ballots to w3c-html-review@w3.org. Please send any comments of a
confidential nature in separate email to w3t-html@w3.org, which is
visible to the Team only.</p>

<p>No sooner than 14 days after the end of the review period, the
Director will announce the document's disposition: it may become a W3C
Recommendation (possibly with minor changes), it may revert to Working
Draft status, or it may be dropped as a W3C work item.</p>

<p>Publication as a Proposed Recommendation does not imply endorsement
by the W3C membership.  This is still a draft document and may be
updated, replaced or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is
inappropriate to cite W3C Proposed Recommendation as other than "work

<h1><a name="xhtml" id="xhtml">1. What is XHTML?</a></h1>

<p>XHTML is a family of current and future document types and modules that
reproduce, subset, and extend HTML 4.0 <a href="#ref-html4">[HTML]</a>. XHTML family document types are <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> based,
and ultimately are designed to work in conjunction with XML-based user agents.
The details of this family and its evolution are
discussed in more detail in the section on <a href="#future">Future
Directions</a>. </p>

<p>XHTML 1.0 (this specification) is the first document type in the XHTML
family. It is a reformulation of the three HTML 4.0 document types as
applications of XML 1.0 <a href="#ref-xml"> [XML]</a>. It is intended
to be used as a language for content that is both XML-conforming and, if some
simple <a href="#guidelines">guidelines</a> are followed, 
operates in HTML 4.0 conforming user agents. Developers who migrate
their content to XHTML 1.0 will realize the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>XHTML documents are XML conforming. As such, they are readily viewed,
edited, and validated with standard XML tools.</li>
<li>XHTML documents can be written to
to operate as well or better than they did before in existing
HTML 4.0-conforming user agents as well as in new, XHTML 1.0 conforming user
agents.</li>
<li>XHTML documents can utilize applications (e.g. scripts and applets) that rely
upon either the HTML Document Object Model or the XML Document Object Model <a
href="#ref-dom">[DOM]</a>.</li>
<li>As the XHTML family evolves, documents conforming to XHTML 1.0 will be more
likely to interoperate within and among various XHTML environments.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XHTML family is the next step in the evolution of the Internet. By
migrating to XHTML today, content developers can enter the XML world with all
of its attendant benefits, while still remaining confident in their
content's backward and future compatibility.</p>

<h2><a name="html4" id="html4">1.1 What is HTML 4.0?</a></h2>

<p>HTML 4.0 <a href="#ref-html4">[HTML]</a> is an <abbr title="Standard
Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr> (Standard
Generalized Markup Language) application conforming to
International Standard <abbr title="Organization for International
Standardization">ISO</abbr> 8879, and is widely regarded as the
standard publishing language of the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>SGML is a language for describing markup languages,
particularly those used in electronic document exchange, document
management, and document publishing. HTML is an example of a
language defined in SGML.</p>

<p>SGML has been around since the middle 1980's and has remained
quite stable. Much of this stability stems from the fact that the
language is both feature-rich and flexible. This flexibility,
however, comes at a price, and that price is a level of
complexity that has inhibited its adoption in a diversity of
environments, including the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>HTML, as originally conceived, was to be a language for the
exchange of scientific and other technical documents, suitable
for use by non-dTML addressed the problem
of SGML complexity by specifying a small set of structural and
semantic tags suitable for authoring relatively simple documents.
In addition to simplifying the document structure, HTML added
support for hypertext. Multimedia capabilities were added
later.</p>

<p>In a remarkably short space of time, HTML became wildly
popular and rapidly outgrew its original purpose. Since HTML's
inception, there has been rapid invention of new elements for use
within HTML (as a standard) and for adapting HTML to vertical,
highly specialized, markets. This plethora of new elements has
led to compatibility problems for documents across different
platforms.</p>

<p>As the heterogeneity of both software and platforms rapidly
proliferate, it is clear that the suitability of 'classic' HTML
4.0 for use on these platforms is somewhat limited.</p>

<h2><a name="xml" id="xml">1.2 What is XML?</a></h2>

<p>XML<sup>&#8482;</sup> is the shorthand for Extensible Markup
Language, and is an acronym of Extensible Markup Language <a
href="#ref-xml">[XML]</a>.</p>

<p>XML was conceived as a means of regaining the power and
flexibility of SGML without most of its complexity. Although a
restricted form of SGML, XML nonetheless preserves most of SGML's
power and richness, and yet still retains all of SGML's commonly
used features.</p>

<p>While retaining these beneficial features, XML removes many of
the more complex features of SGML that make the authoring and
design of suitable software both difficult and costly.</p>

<h2><a name="why" id="why">1.3 Why the need for XHTML?</a></h2>

<p>The benefits of migrating to XHTML 1.0 are described above. Some of the
benefits of migrating to XHTML in general are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Document developers and user agent designers are constantly
discovering new ways to express their ideas through new markup. In XML, it is
relatively easy to introduce new elements or additional element
attributes.  The XHTML family is designed to accommodate these extensions
through XHTML modules and techniques for developing new XHTML-conforming
modules (described in the forthcoming XHTML Modularization specification).
These modules will permit the combination of existing and
new feature sets when developing content and when designing new user
agents.</li>

<li>Alternate ways of accessing the Internet are constantly being
introduced.  Some estimates indicate that by the year 2002, 75% of
Internet document viewing will be carried out on these alternate
platforms.  The XHTML family is designed with general user agent
interoperability in mind. Through a new user agent and document profiling
mechanism, servers, proxies, and user agents will be able to perform
best effort content transformation. Ultimately, it will be possible to
develop XHTML-conforming content that is usable by any XHTML-conforming
user agent.</li>

interpreted as an implementation recommendation, but not a
requirement. With respect to documents, the word "should" is to
bO interpreted as recommended programming practice for documents
and a requirement for Strictly Conforming XHTML Documents.</dd>

<dt>Supported</dt>

<dd>Certain facilities in this specification are optional. If a
facility is supported, it behaves as specified by this
specification.</dd>

<dt>Unspecified</dt>

<dd>When a value or behavior is unspecified, the specification
defines no portability requirements for a facility on an
implementation even when faced with a document that uses the
facility. A document that requires specific behavior in such an
instance, rather than tolerating any behavior when using that
facility, is not a Strictly Conforming XHTML Document.</dd>

<dt>Attribute</dt>

<dd>An attribute is a parameter to an element declared in the
DTD. An attribute's type and value range, including a possible
default value, are defined in the DTD.</dd>

<dt>DTD</dt>

<dd>A DTD, or document type definition, is a collection of XML
declarations that, as a collection, defines the legal structure,
<span class="term">elements</span>, and <span class="term">
attributes</span> that are available for use in a document that
complies to the DTD.</dd>

<dt>Document</dt>

<dd>A document is a stream of data that, after being combined
with any other streams it references, is structured such that it
holds information contained within <span class="term">
elements</span> that are organized as defined in the associated
<span class="term">DTD</span>. See <a href="#docconf">Document
Conformance</a> for more information.</dd>

<dt>Element</dt>

<dd>An element is a document structuring unit declared in the
<span class="term">DTD</span>. The element's content model is
defined in the <span class="term">DTD</span>, and additional
semantics may be defined in the prose description of the
element.</dd>

<dt><a name="facilities" id="facilities">Facilities</a></dt>

<dd>Functionality includes <span class="term">elements</span>,
<span class="term">attributes</span>, and the semantics
associated with those <span class="term">elements</span> and
<span class="term">attributes</span>. An implementation
supporting that functionality is said to provide the necessary
facilities.</dd>

<dt>Implementation</dt>

<dd>An implementation is a system that provides collection of
<span class="term">facilities</span> and services that supports
this specification. See <a href="#uaconf">User Agent
Conformance</a> for more information.</dd>

<dt>Parsing</dt>

<dd>Parsing is the act whereby a <span class="term">
document</span> is scanned, and the information contained within
the <span class="term">document</span> is filtered into the
context of the <span class="term">elements</span> in which the
information is structured.</dd>

<dt>Rendering</dt>

<dd>Rendering is the act whereby the information in a <span
class="term">document</span> is presented. This presentation is
done in the form most appropriate to the environment (e.g.
aurally, visrally, in print).</dd>

<dt>User Agent</dt>

<dd>A user agent is an <span class="term">implementation</span>
that retrieves and processes XHTML documents. See <a href=
"#uaconf">User Agent Conformance</a> for more information.</dd>

<dt>Validation</dt>

<dd>Validation is a process whereby <span class="term">
documents</span> are verified against the associated <span class= 
"term">DTD</span>, ensuring that the structure, use of <span
class="term">elements</span>, and use of <span class="term">
attributes</span> are consistent with the definitions in the
<span class="term">DTD</span>.</dd>

<dt><a name="wellformed" id=></dt>

<dd>A <span class="term">document</span> is well-formed when it
is structured according to the rules defined in <a href= 
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#sec-well-formed">Section 2.1</a> of
the XML 1.0 Recommendation <a href="#ref-xml">[XML]</a>.
Basically, this definition states that elements, delimited by
their start and end tags, are nested properly within one
another.</dd>

<h2><a name="docconf" id="docconf">3.1 Document
Conformance</a></h2>

<p>This version of XHTML provides a definition of strictly
con    ing XHTML documents, which are restricted to tags and
attributes from the XHTML namespace. See <a href=
"#well-formed">Section 3.1.2</a> for information on using XHTML
with other namespaces, for instance, to include metadata
expressed in <abbr title="Resource Description Format">RDF</abbr> within XHTML documents.</p>

<h3><a name="strict" id="strict">3.1.1 Strictly Conforming
Documents</a></h3>

<p>A Strictly Conforming XHTML Document is a document that
requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this
specification. Such a document must meet all of the following
criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>It must validate against one of the three DTDs found in <a
href="#dtds">Appendix&#160;A</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The root element of the document must be <code>
&lt;html&gt;</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>The root element of the document must designate the XHTML
namespace using the <code>xmlns</code> attribute <a href= 
"#ref-xmlns">[XMLNAMES]</a>. The namespace for XHTML is
defined to be 
<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>There must be a DOCTYPE declaration in the document prior to
the root element. The public identifier included in
the DOCTYPE declaration must reference one of the three DTDs
found in <a href="#dtds">Appendix&#160;A</a> using the respective
Formal Public Identifier. The system identifier may be changed to reflect
local system conventions.</p>

<p>Note that in this example, the XML declaration is included. An XML
declaration like the one above is
not required in all XML documents. XHTML document authors are strongly encouraged to use XML declarations in all their documents. Such a declaration is required
when the character encoding of the document is other than the default UTF-8 or
UTF-16.</p>
