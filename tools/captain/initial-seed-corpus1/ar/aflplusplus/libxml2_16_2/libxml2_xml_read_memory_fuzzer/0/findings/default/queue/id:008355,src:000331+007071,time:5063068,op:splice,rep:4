<abstract>
<p>The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a subset of
SGML that is completely described in this document. Its goal is to
enable generic SGML to be served, received, and processed on the Web
in the way that is now possible with HTML. XML has been designed for
ease of implementation and for interoperability with both SGML and
HTML.</p>
</abstract>
<status>
<p>This document has been reviewed by W3C Members and
other interested parties and has been endorsed by the
Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable
document and may be used as reference material or cited
as a normative reference from another document. W3C's
role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention
to the specification and to promote its widespread
deployment. This enhances the functionality and
interoperability of the Web.</p>
<p>
This document specifies a syntax created by subsetting an existing,
widely used international text processing standard (Standard
Generalized Markup Language, ISO 8879:1986(E) as amended and
corrected) for use on the World Wide Web.  It is a product of the W3C
XML Activity, details of which can be found at <loc
href='http://www.w3.org/XML'>http://www.w3.org/XML</loc>.  A list of
current W3C Recommendations and other technical documents can be found
at <loc href='http://www.w3.org/TR'>http://www.w3.org/TR</loc>.
</p>
<p>This specification uses the term URI, which is defined by <bibref
ref="Berners-Lee"/>, a work in progress expected to update <bibref
ref="RFC1738"/> and <bibref ref="RFC1808"/>.

<sitem>1997-12-03 : CMSMcQ : yet further changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : TB : further changes (see TB to XML WG,
2 December 1997)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-02 : CMSMcQ : deal with as many corrections and
comments from the proofreaders as possible:
entify hard-coded document date in pubdate element,
change expansion of entity WebSGML,
update status description as per Dan Connolly (am not sure
about refernece to Berners-Lee et al.),
add 'The' to abstract as per WG decision,
move Relationship to Existing Standards to back matter and
combine with References,
re-order back matter so normative appendices come first,
re-tag back matter so informative appendices are tagged informdiv1,
remove XXX XXX from list of 'normative' specs in prose,
move some references from Other References to Normative References,
add RFC 1738, 1808, and 2141 to Other References (they are not
normative since we do not require the processor to enforce any 
rules based on them),
add reference to 'Fielding draft' (Berners-Lee et al.),
move notation section to end of body,
drop URIchar non-terminal and use SkipLit instead,
lose stray reference to defunct nonterminal 'markupdecls',
move reference to Aho et al. into appendix (Tim's right),
add prose note saying that hash marks and fragment identifiers are
NOT part of the URI formally speaking, and are NOT legal in 
system identifiers (processor 'may' signal an error).
Work through:
Tim Bray reacting to James Clark,
Tim Bray on his own,
Eve Maler,

NOT DONE YET:
change binary / text to unparsed / parsed.
handle James's suggestion about &lt; in attriubte values
uppercase hex characters,
namechar list,
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : JB : add some column-width parameters</sitem>
<sitem>1997-12-01 : CMSMcQ : begin round of changes to incorporate
recent WG decisions and other corrections:
binding sources of character encoding info (27 Aug / 3 Sept),
correct wording of Faust quotation (restore dropped line),
drop SDD from EncodingDecl,
change text at version number 1.0,
drop misleading (wrong!) sentence about ignorables and extenders,
modify definition of PCData to make bar on msc grammatical,
change grammar's handling of internal subset (drop non-terminal markupdecls),
change definition of includeSect to allow conditional sections,
add integral-declaration constraint on internal subset,
drop misleading / dangerous sentence about relationship of
entities with system storage objects,
change table body tag to htbody as per EM change to DTD,
add rule about space normalization in public identifiers,
add description of how to generate our name-space rules from 
Unicode character database (needs further work!).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-08 : TB : Removed %-constructs again, new rules
for PE appearance.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-10-01 : TB : Case-sensitive markup; cleaned up
element-type defs, lotsa little edits for style</sitem>
<sitem>1997-09-25 : TB : Change to elm's new DTD, with
substantial detail cleanup as a side-effect</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-24 : CMSMcQ : correct error (lost *) in definition 
of ignoreSectContents (thanks to Makoto Murata)</sitem>
<sitem>Allow all empty elements to have end-tags, consistent with
SGML TC (as per JJC).</sitem>
<sitem>1997-07-23 : CMSMcQ : pre-emptive strike on pending corrections:
introduce the term 'empty-element tag', note that all empty elements
may use it, and elements declared EMPTY must use it.
Add WFC requiring encoding decl to come first in an entity.
Redefine notations to point to PIs as well as binary entities.
Change autodetection table by removing bytes 3 and 4 from 
examples with Byte Order Mark.
Add content model as a term and clarify that it applies to both
mixed and element content.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-30 : CMSMcQ : change date, some cosmetic changes,
changes to productions for choice, seq, Mixed, NotationType,
Enumeration.  Follow James Clark's suggestion and prohibit 
conditional sections in internal subset.  TO DO:  simplify
production for ignored sections as a result, since we don't 
need to worry about parsers which don't expand PErefs finding
a conditional section.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : TB : various edits</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-29 : CMSMcQ : further changes:
Suppress old FINAL EDIT comments and some dead material.
Revise occurrences of % in grammar to exploit Henry Thompson's pun,
especially markupdecl and attdef.
Remove RMD requirement relating to element content (?).
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-06-28 : CMSMcQ : Various changes for 1 July draft:
Add text for draconian error handling (introduce
the term Fatal Error).
RE deleta est (changing wording from 
original announcement to restrict the requirement to validating
parsers).
Tag definition of validating processor and link to it.
Add colon as name character.
Change def of %operator.
Change standard definitions of lt, gt, amp.
Strip leading zeros from #x00nn forms.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-02 : CMSMcQ : final corrections of editorial errors
found in last night's proofreading.  Reverse course once more on
well-formed:   Webster's Second hyphenates it, and that's enough
for me.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-04-01 : CMSMcQ : corrections from JJC, EM, HT, and self</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-31 : Tim Bray : many changes</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-29 : CMSMcQ : some Henry Thompson (on entity handling),
some Charles Goldfarb, some ERB decisions (PE handling in miscellaneous
declarations.  Changed Ident element to accept def attribute.
Allow normalization of Unicode characters.  move def of systemliteral
into section on literals.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-28 : CMSMcQ : make as many corrections as possible, from
Terry Allen, Norbert Mikula, James Clark, Jon Bosak, Henry Thompson,
Paul Grosso, and self.  Among other things:  give in on "well formed"
(Terry is right), tentatively rename QuotedCData as AttValue
and Literal as EntityValue to be more informative, since attribute
values are the <emph>only</emph> place QuotedCData was used, and
vice versa for entity text and Literal. (I'd call it Entity Text, 
but 8879 uses that name for both internal and external entities.)</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-26 : CMSMcQ : resynch the two forks of this draft, reapply
my changes dated 03-20 and 03-21.  Normalize old 'may not' to 'must not'
except in the one case where it meant 'may or may not'.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : TB : massive changes on plane flight from Chicago
to Vancouver</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-21 : CMSMcQ : correct as many reported errors as possible.
</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : correct typos listed in CMSMcQ hand copy of spec.</sitem>
<sitem>1997-03-20 : CMSMcQ : cosmetic changes preparatory to revision for
WWW conference April 1997:  restore some of the internal entity 
references (e.g. to docdate, etc.), change character xA0 to &amp;nbsp;
and define nbsp as &amp;#160;, and refill a lot of paragraphs for
legibility.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-12 : CMSMcQ : revise using Tim's edits:
Add list type of NUMBERED and change most lists either to
BULLETS or to NUMBERED.
Suppress QuotedNames, Names (not used).
Correct trivial-grammar doc type decl.
Rename 'marked section' as 'CDATA section' passim.
Also edits from James Clark:
Define the set of characters from which [^abc] subtracts.
Charref should use just [0-9] not Digit.
Location info needs cleaner treatment:  remove?  (ERB
question).
One example of a PI has wrong pic.
Clarify discussion of encoding names.
Encoding failure should lead to unspecified results; don't
prescribe error recovery.
Don't require exposure of entity boundaries.
Ignore white space in element content.
Reserve entity names of the form u-NNNN.
Clarify relative URLs.
And some of my own:
Correct productions for content model:  model cannot
consist of a name, so "elements ::= cp" is no good.
</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-11 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Add new rhs to entity declaration, for parameter entities.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-11-10 : CMSMcQ : revise for style.
Fix / complete section on names, characters.
Add sections on parameter entities, conditional sections.
Still to do:  Add compatibility note on deterministic content models.
Finish stylistic revision.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-31 : TB : Add Entity Handling section</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-30 : TB : Clean up term &amp; termdef.  Slip in
ERB decision re EMPTY.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-28 : TB : Change DTD.  Implement some of Michael's
suggestions.  Change comments back to //.  Introduce language for
XML namespace reservation.  Add section on white-space handling.
Lots more cleanup.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-24 : CMSMcQ : quick tweaks, implement some ERB
decisions.  Characters are not integers.  Comments are /* */ not //.
Add bibliographic refs to 10646, HyTime, Unicode.
Rename old Cdata as MsData since it's <emph>only</emph> seen
in marked sections.  Call them attribute-value pairs not
name-value pairs, except once.  Internal subset is optional, needs
'?'.  Implied attributes should be signaled to the app, not
have values supplied by processor.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-16 : TB : track down &amp; excise all DSD references;
introduce some EBNF for entity declarations.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-?? : TB : consistency check, fix up scraps so
they all parse, get formatter working, correct a few productions.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-10/11 : CMSMcQ : various maintenance, stylistic, and
organizational changes:
Replace a few literals with xmlpio and
pic entities, to make them consistent and ensure we can change pic
reliably when the ERB votes.
Drop paragraph on recognizers from notation section.
Add match, exact match to terminology.
Move old 2.2 XML Processors and Apps into intro.
Mention comments, PIs, and marked sections in discussion of
delimiter escaping.
Streamline discussion of doctype decl syntax.
Drop old section of 'PI syntax' for doctype decl, and add
section on partial-DTD summary PIs to end of Logical Structures
section.
Revise DSD syntax section to use Tim's subset-in-a-PI
mechanism.</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-10 : TB : eliminate name recognizers (and more?)</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-09 : CMSMcQ : revise for style, consistency through 2.3
(Characters)</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-09 : CMSMcQ : re-unite everything for convenience,
at least temporarily, and revise quickly</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-08 : TB : first major homogenization pass</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-08 : TB : turn "current" attribute on div type into 
CDATA</sitem>
<sitem>1996-10-02 : TB : remould into skeleton + entities</sitem>
<sitem>1996-09-30 : CMSMcQ : add a few more sections prior to exchange
                            with Tim.</sitem>

<head>Introduction</head>
<p>Extensible Markup Language, abbreviated XML, describes a class of
data objects called <termref def="dt-xml-doc">XML documents</termref> and
partially describes the behavior of 
computer programs which process them. XML is an application profile or
restricted form of SGML, the Standard Generalized Markup 
Language <bibref ref='ISO8879'/>.
By construction, XML documents 
are conforming SGML documents.
</p>
<p>XML documents are made up of storage units called <termref
def="dt-entity">entities</termref>, which contain either parsed
or unparsed data.
Parsed data is made up of <termref def="dt-character">characters</termref>,
some 
of which form <termref def="dt-chardata">character data</termref>, 
and some of which form <termref def="dt-markup">markup</termref>.
Markup encodes a description of the document's storage layout and
logical structure. XML provides a mechanism to impose constraints on
the storage layout and logical structure.</p>
<p><termdef id="dt-xml-proc" term="XML Processor">A software module
called an <term>XML processor</term> is used to read XML documents
and provide access to their content and structure.</termdef> <termdef
id="dt-app" term="Application">It is assumed that an XML processor is
doing its work on behalf of another module, called the
<term>application</term>.</termdef> This specification describes the
required behavior of an XML processor in terms of how it must read XML
data and the information it must provide to the application.</p>
 
<div2 id='sec-origin-goals'>
<head>Origin and Goals</head>
<p>XML was developed by an XML Working Group (originally known as the
SGML Editorial Review Board) formed under the auspices of the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996.
It was chaired by Jon Bosak of Sun
Microsystems with the active participation of an XML Special
Interest Group (previously known as the SGML Working Group) also
organized by the W3C. The membership of the XML Working Group is given
in an appendix. Dan Connolly served as the WG's contact with the W3C.
</p>
<p>The design goals for XML are:<olist>
<item><p>XML shall be straightforwardly usable over the
Internet.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall support a wide variety of applications.</p></item>
<item><p>XML shall be compatible with SGML.</p></item>
<item><p>It shall be easy to write programs which process XML
documents.</p></item>
<item><p>The number of optional features in XML is to be kept to the
absolute minimum, ideally zero.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents should be human-legible and reasonably
clear.</p></item>
<item><p>The XML design should be prepared quickly.</p></item>
<item><p>The design of XML shall be formal and concise.</p></item>
<item><p>XML documents shall be easy to create.</p></item>
<item><p>Terseness in XML markup is of minimal importance.</p></item></olist>
</p>
<p>This specification, 
together with associated standards
(Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646 for characters,
Internet RFC 1766 for language identification tags, 
ISO 639 for language name codes, and 
ISO 3166 for country name codes),
provides all the information necessary to understand 
XML Version &XML.version;
and construct computer programs to process it.</p>
<p>This version of the XML specification
<!-- is for &doc.audience;.-->
&doc.distribution;.</p>

</div2>
 


 
<div2 id='sec-terminology'>
<head>Terminology</head>
 
<p>The terminology used to describe XML documents is defined in the body of
this specification.
The terms defined in the following list are used in building those
definitions and in describing the actions of an XML processor:
<glist>
<gitem>
<label>may</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-may" term="May">Conforming documents and XML
processors are permitted to but need not behave as
described.</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>must</label>
<def><p>Conforming documents and XML processors 
are required to behave as described; otherwise they are in error.
<!-- do NOT change this! this is what defines a violation of
a 'must' clause as 'an error'. -MSM -->
</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>error</label>
<def><p><termdef id='dt-error' term='Error'
>A violation of the rules of this
specification; results are
undefined.  Conforming software may detect and report an error and may
recover from it.</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>fatal error</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-fatal" term="Fatal Error">An error
which a conforming <termref def="dt-xml-proc">XML processor</termref>
must detect and report to the application.
After encountering a fatal error, the
processor may continue
processing the data to search for further errors and may report such
errors to the application.  In order to support correction of errors,
the processor may make unprocessed data from the document (with
intermingled character data and markup) available to the application.
Once a fatal error is detected, however, the processor must not
continue normal processing (i.e., it must not
continue to pass character data and information about the document's
logical structure to the application in the normal way).
</termdef></p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>at user option</label>
<def><p>Conforming software may or must (depending on the modal verb in the
sentence) behave as described; if it does, it must
provide users a means to enable or disable the behavior
described.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>validity constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all 
<termref def="dt-valid">valid</termref> XML documents.
Violations of validity constraints are errors; they must, at user option, 
be reported by 
<termref def="dt-validating">validating XML processors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>
<gitem>
<label>well-formedness constraint</label>
<def><p>A rule which applies to all <termref
def="dt-wellformed">well-formed</termref> XML documents.
Violations of well-formedness constraints are 
<termref def="dt-fatal">fatal errors</termref>.</p></def>
</gitem>

<gitem>
<label>match</label>
<def><p><termdef id="dt-match" term="match">(Of strings or names:) 
Two strings or names being compared must be identical.
Characters with multiple possible representations in ISO/IEC 10646 (e.g.
characters with 
both precomposed and base+diacritic forms) match only if they have the
same representation in both strings.
At user option, processors may normalize such characters to
some canonical form.
No case folding is performed. 
(Of strings and rules in the grammar:)  
A string matches a grammatical production if it belongs to the
language generated by that production.
(Of content and content models:)
An element matches its declaration when it conforms
in the fashion described in the constraint
<specref ref='elementvalid'/>.

<p>The colon character within XML names is reserved for experimentation with

(There is no guarantee that any name-space mechanism
adopted for XML will in fact use the colon as a name-space delimiter.)
In practice, this means that authors should not use the colon in XML
names except as part of name-space experiments, but that XML processors
should accept the colon as a name character.</p>

<p>The external subset and external parameter entities also differ 
from the internal subset in that in them,
<termref def="dt-PERef">parameter-entity references</termref>
are permitted <emph>within</emph> markup declarations,
not only <emph>between</emph> markup declarations.</p>
<p>An example of an XML document with a document type declaration:
<eg><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE greeting SYSTEM "hello.dtd">
<greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
]]></eg>
The <termref def="dt-sysid">system identifier</termref> 
"<code>hello.dtd</code>" gives the URI of a DTD for the document.</p>
<p>The declarations can also be given locally, as in this 
example:
<eg><![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<!DOCTYPE greeting [
  <!ELEMENT greeting (#PCDATA)>
]>
<greeting>Hello, world!</greeting>
]]></eg>
If both the external and internal subsets are used, the 
internal subset is considered to occur before the external subset.
<!-- 'is considered to'? boo. whazzat mean? -->
This has the effect that entity and attribute-list declarations in the
internal subset take precedence over those in the external subset.

<head>Standalone Document Declaration</head>
<p>Markup declarations can affect the content of the document,
as passed from an <termref def="dt-xml-proc">XML processor</termref> 
to an application; examples are attribute defaults and entity
declarations.
The standalone document declaration,
which may appear as a component of the XML declaration, signals
whether or not there are such declarations which appear external to 
the <termref def='dt-docent'>document entity</termref>.

In a standalone document declaration, the value "<code>yes</code>" indicates

external parameter entity referenced from the internal subset)
which affect the information passed from the XML processor to

The value "<code>no</code>" indicates that there are or may be such
external markup declarations.
Note that the standalone document declaration only

document, of 
references to external <emph>entities</emph>, when those entities are
internally declared,

<div2 id='sec-white-space'>
<head>White Space Handling</head>

<p>In editing XML documents, it is often convenient to use "white space"
(spaces, tabs, and blank lines, denoted by the nonterminal 
<nt def='NT-S'>S</nt> in this specification) to
set apart the markup for greater readability.  Such white space is typically
not intended for inclusion in the delivered version of the document.
On the other hand, "significant" white space that should be preserved in the
delivered version is common, for example in poetry and
source code.</p>
<p>An <termref def='dt-xml-proc'>XML processor</termref> 
must always pass all characters in a document that are not
markup through to the application.   A <termref def='dt-validating'>
validating XML processor</termref> must also inform the application
which  of these characters constitute white space appearing
in <termref def="dt-elemcontent">element content</termref>.
</p>
<p>A special <termref def='dt-attr'>attribute</termref> 
named <kw>xml:space</kw> may be attached to an element
to signal an intention that in that element,
white space should be preserved by applications.
In valid documents, this attribute, like any other, must be 
<termref def="dt-attdecl">declared</termref> if it is used.
When declared, it must be given as an 
<termref def='dt-enumerated'>enumerated type</termref> whose only
possible values are "<code>default</code>" and "<code>preserve</code>".
For example:<eg><![CDATA[    <!ATTLIST poem   xml:space (default|preserve) 'preserve'>]]></eg></p>
<p>The value "<code>default</code>" signals that applications'
default white-space processing modes are acceptable for this element; the
value "<code>preserve</code>" indicates the intent that applications preserve
all the white space.
This declared intent is considered to apply to all elements within the content
of the element where it is specified, unless overriden with another instance
of the <kw>xml:space</kw> attribute.
</p>
<p>The <termref def='dt-root'>root element</termref> of any document
is considered to have signaled no intentions as regards application space
handling, unless it provides a value for 
this attribute or the attribute is declared with a default value.
</p>

</div2>
<div2 id='sec-line-ends'>
<head>End-of-Line Handling</head>
<p>XML <termref def='dt-parsedent'>parsed entities</termref> are often stored in
computer files which, for editing convenience, are organized into lines.
These lines are typically separated by some combination of the characters
carriage-return (#xD) and line-feed (#xA).</p>
<p>To simplify the tasks of <termref def='dt-app'>applications</termref>,
wherever an external parsed entity or the literal entity value
of an internal parsed entity contains either the literal 
two-character sequence "#xD#xA" or a standalone literal
#xD, an <termref def='dt-xml-proc'>XML processor</termref> must 
pass to the application the single character #xA.
(This behavior can 
conveniently be produced by normalizing all 
line breaks to #xA on input, before parsing.)

<div2 id='sec-lang-tag'>
<head>Language Identification</head>
<p>In document processing, it is often useful to
identify the natural or formal language 
in which the content is 
written.
A special <termref def="dt-attr">attribute</termref> named
<kw>xml:lang</kw> may be inserted in
documents to specify the 
language used in the contents and attribute values 
of any element in an XML document.
In valid documents, this attribute, like any other, must be 
<termref def="dt-attdecl">declared</termref> if it is used.
The values of the attribute are language identifiers as defined
by <bibref ref="RFC1766"/>, "Tags for the Identification of Languages":

The <nt def='NT-Langcode'>Langcode</nt> may be any of the following:
<ulist>
<item><p>a two-letter language code as defined by 
<bibref ref="ISO639"/>, "Codes

<item><p>a language identifier registered with the Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority <bibref ref='IANA'/>; these begin with the 
prefix "<code>i-</code>" (or "<code>I-</code>")</p></item>
<item><p>a language identifier assigned by the user, or agreed on
between parties in private use; these must begin with the
prefix "<code>x-</code>" or "<code>X-</code>" in order to ensure that they do not conflict 
with names later standardized or registered with IANA</p></item>
</ulist></p>
<p>There may be any number of <nt def='NT-Subcode'>Subcode</nt> segments; if
the first 
subcode segment exists and the Subcode consists of two 
letters, then it must be a country code from 
<bibref ref="ISO3166"/>, "Codes 
for the representation of names of countries."
If the first 
subcode consists of more than two letters, it must be
a subcode for the language in question registered with IANA,
unless the <nt def='NT-Langcode'>Langcode</nt> begins with the prefix 
"<code>x-</code>" or
"<code>X-</code>". </p>
<p>It is customary to give the language code in lower case, and
the country code (if any) in upper case.
Note that these values, unlike other names in XML documents,
are case insensitive.</p>
<p>For example:
<eg><![CDATA[<p xml:lang="en">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
<p xml:lang="en-GB">What colour is it?</p>
<p xml:lang="en-US">What color is it?</p>

<!--<p>The xml:lang value is considered to apply both to the contents of an
element and 
(unless otherwise via attribute default values) to the
values of all of its attributes with free-text (CDATA) values.  -->
<p>The intent declared with <kw>xml:lang</kw> is considered to apply to
all attributes and content of the element where it is specified,
unless overridden with an instance of <kw>xml:lang</kw>
on another element within that content.</p>
<!--
If no
value is specified for xml:lang on an element, and no default value is
defined for it in the DTD, then the xml:lang attribute of any element
takes the same value it has in the parent element, if any.  The two
technical terms in the following example both have the same effective
value for xml:lang:

  <p xml:lang="en">Here the keywords are
  <term xml:lang="en">shift</term> and
  <term>reduce</term>. ...</p>

The application, not the XML processor, is responsible for this '
inheritance' of attribute values.
-->
<p>A simple declaration for <kw>xml:lang</kw> might take
the form
<eg>xml:lang  NMTOKEN  #IMPLIED</eg>
but specific default values may also be given, if appropriate.  In a
collection of French poems for English students, with glosses and
notes in English, the xml:lang attribute might be declared this way:
<eg><![CDATA[    <!ATTLIST poem   xml:lang NMTOKEN 'fr'>
    <!ATTLIST gloss  xml:lang NMTOKEN 'en'>
    <!ATTLIST note   xml:lang NMTOKEN 'en'>]]></eg>

the choice list appears in the grammar;
content particles occurring in a sequence list must each
appear in the <termref def="dt-elemcontent">element content</termref> in the
order given in the list.  
The optional character following a name or list governs
whether the element or the content particles in the list may occur one
or more (<code>+</code>), zero or more (<code>*</code>), or zero or 
one times (<code>?</code>).  
The absence of such an operator means that the element or content particle
must appear exactly once.
This syntax
and meaning are identical to those used in the productions in this

The content of an element matches a content model if and only if it is

section are part of the DTD.
If the keyword of the conditional
section is <kw>IGNORE</kw>, then the contents of the conditional section are

Note that for reliable parsing, the contents of even ignored
conditional sections must be read in order to
detect nested conditional sections and ensure that the end of the
outermost (ignored) conditional section is properly detected.
If a conditional section with a
keyword of <kw>INCLUDE</kw> occurs within a larger conditional

reference to it which appears in a default value in an attribute-list
declaration.</p>

Note that the hash mark (<code>#</code>) and fragment identifier 
frequently used with URIs are not, formally, part of the URI itself; 
an XML processor may signal an error if a fragment identifier is 
given as part of a system identifier.
Unless otherwise provided by information outside the scope of this
specification (e.g. a special XML element type defined by a particular
DTD, or a processing instruction defined by a particular application
specification), relative URIs are relative to the location of the
resource within which the entity declaration occurs.
A URI might thus be relative to the 
<termref def='dt-docent'>document entity</termref>, to the entity
containing the <termref def='dt-doctype'>external DTD subset</termref>, 
or to some other <termref def='dt-extent'>external parameter entity</termref>.
</p>
<p>An XML processor should handle a non-ASCII character in a URI by
representing the character in UTF-8 as one or more bytes, and then 
escaping these bytes with the URI escaping mechanism (i.e., by
converting each byte to %HH, where HH is the hexadecimal notation of the
byte value).</p>
<p><termdef id="dt-pubid" term="Public identifier">
In addition to a system identifier, an external identifier may
include a <term>public identifier</term>.</termdef>  
An XML processor attempting to retrieve the entity's content may use the public
identifier to try to generate an alternative URI.  If the processor
is unable to do so, it must use the URI specified in the system
literal.  Before a match is attempted, all strings
of white space in the public identifier must be normalized to single space characters (#x20),
and leading and trailing white space must be removed.</p>

<div3 id='charencoding'>
<head>Character Encoding in Entities</head>
 
<p>Each external parsed entity in an XML document may use a different
encoding for its characters. All XML processors must be able to read
entities in either UTF-8 or UTF-16. 

</p>
<p>Entities encoded in UTF-16 must
begin with the Byte Order Mark described by ISO/IEC 10646 Annex E and
Unicode Appendix B (the ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE character, #xFEFF).
This is an encoding signature, not part of either the markup or the
character data of the XML document.
XML processors must be able to use this character to
differentiate between UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded documents.</p>
<p>Although an XML processor is required to read only entities in
the UTF-8 and UTF-16 encodings, it is recognized that other encodings are
used around the world, and it may be desired for XML processors
to read entities that use them.
Parsed entities which are stored in an encoding other than
UTF-8 or UTF-16 must begin with a <titleref href='TextDecl'>text
declaration</titleref> containing an encoding declaration:
<scrap lang='ebnf'>
<head>Encoding Declaration</head>
<prod id='NT-EncodingDecl'><lhs>EncodingDecl</lhs>
<rhs><nt def="NT-S">S</nt>
'encoding' <nt def='NT-Eq'>Eq</nt> 
('"' <nt def='NT-EncName'>EncName</nt> '"' | 
"'" <nt def='NT-EncName'>EncName</nt> "'" )
</rhs>
</prod>
<prod id='NT-EncName'><lhs>EncName</lhs>
<rhs>[A-Za-z] ([A-Za-z0-9._] | '-')*</rhs>
<com>Encoding name contains only Latin characters</com>
</prod>
</scrap>
In the <termref def='dt-docent'>document entity</termref>, the encoding
declaration is part of the <termref def="dt-xmldecl">XML declaration</termref>.
The <nt def="NT-EncName">EncName</nt> is the name of the encoding used.
</p>
<!-- FINAL EDIT:  check name of IANA and charset names -->
<p>In an encoding declaration, the values
"<code>UTF-8</code>",
"<code>UTF-16</code>",
"<code>ISO-10646-UCS-2</code>", and
"<code>ISO-10646-UCS-4</code>" should be 
used for the various encodings and transformations of Unicode /
ISO/IEC 10646, the values
"<code>ISO-8859-1</code>",
"<code>ISO-8859-2</code>", ...
"<code>ISO-8859-9</code>" should be used for the parts of ISO 8859, and
the values
"<code>ISO-2022-JP</code>",
"<code>Shift_JIS</code>", and
"<code>EUC-JP</code>"
should be used for the various encoded forms of JIS X-0208-1997.  XML
processors may recognize other encodings; it is recommended that
character encodings registered (as <emph>charset</emph>s) 
with the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority <bibref ref='IANA'/>, other than those just listed, should be
referred to
using their registered names.
Note that these registered names are defined to be 
case-insensitive, so processors wishing to match against them 
should do so in a case-insensitive
way.</p>
<p>In the absence of information provided by an external
transport protocol (e.g. HTTP or MIME), 
it is an <termref def="dt-error">error</termref> for an entity including
an encoding declaration to be presented to the XML processor 
in an encoding other than that named in the declaration, 
for an encoding declaration to occur other than at the beginning 
of an external entity, or for
an entity which begins with neither a Byte Order Mark nor an encoding
declaration to use an encoding other than UTF-8.
Note that since ASCII
is a subset of UTF-8, ordinary ASCII entities do not strictly need
an encoding declaration.</p>

<p>It is a <termref def='dt-fatal'>fatal error</termref> when an XML processor
encounters an entity with an encoding that it is unable to process.</p>
