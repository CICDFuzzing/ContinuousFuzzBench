# In the code shown below (which is intended to be run from the
# sqlite3.exe command-line tool) the three SELECT statements should all
# generate the same answer. But the third one does not. It is as if the
# COLLATE clause on the ORDER BY somehow got pulled into the EXCEPT
# operator. Note that the ".print" commands are instructions to the
# sqlite3.exe shell program to output delimiter lines so that you can more
# easily tell where the output of one query ends and the next query
# begins.
