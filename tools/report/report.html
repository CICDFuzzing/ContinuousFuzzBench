                Welcome to the magma report. In here you will be able to see the results of the benched fuzzers
                over the target libraries.
                See <a href="https://github.com/HexHive/magma/blob/master/README.md">here</a> for build and run details.

            <h2>Benchmark process</h2>
               <span>
                   The differents fuzzers are run over the target libraries in which multiple patches have been implemented.
                   These patches reintroduce previous corrected bugs. Once the fuzzer campaign is done you will find in this report how much
                   bugs where triggered and at what moment. All this gives us enought material to establish a benchmark for the used fuzzers.
