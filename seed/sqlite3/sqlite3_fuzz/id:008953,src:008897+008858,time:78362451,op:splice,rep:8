# Verify that SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC functions get factored out of the
# evaluation loop whereas non-deterministic functions do not.  counter1()
# is marked as non-deterministic and so is not factored out of the loop,
# and it really is non-deterministic, returning a different result each
# time.  But counter2() is marked as deterministic, so it does get factored
# out of the loop.  counter2() has the same implementation as counter1(),
# returning a different result on each invocation, but becaus
