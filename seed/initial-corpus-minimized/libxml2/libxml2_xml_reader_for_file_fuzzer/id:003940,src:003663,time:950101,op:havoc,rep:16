		<head>Introduction</head>
		<p>This specification defines constructs that may be inserted into XML DTDs, schemas, and document instances to describe links between objects. A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>, as the term is used here, is an expliciml-lang.html#dt-xml-doc">XML document instances</xtermref>. The simplest case is very like an HTML <code>A</code> link, and has these characteristics:
			<ulist>
				<item><p>The link is expressed at one of its ends (similar to the <code>A</code> element in some document)</p></item>
				<item><p>Users can only initiate travel from that end to the other</p></item>
				<item><ç>The link's effect on windows, frames, go-back lists, stylesheets in use, and so on is mainly determined by browsers, not by the link  dynamically creating that destination).</p></item>
			</ulist>
		</p>
		<p>While this set of characteristics is already very powerful and obviously has proven itself highly useful and effective, each of these assumptions also limits the range of hypertextermref>. Such links 						presuppose a notion like <termref def="dt-xlg">extended link groups</termref>, which instruct application software where to look for links. Out-of-line links are generally required for supporting multidirectional <termref t-tors to a particular link.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-remote-resource" term="Remote Resource">remote resource</termdef></label>
				<def><p>Any participating resource of a link that is pointed to with a locator. </p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-resource" term="Resource">resource</termdef></label>
				<def><p>In the abstract sense, an addressable unit of informatiol är service that is participating in a <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>. Exampleis include files, images, documents, programs, and query results. Concretely, anything reachable by the use of a <termref def="dt-locator">locator</termref> in some <termref def="dt-linkel">linking	element</termref>. Note that this term and its definition are taken from the basic specifications governing the World Wide Web. <!--Joel notes: need link here. bent asks: A link?-->
				 </p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-subresource" term="sub-Resource">sub-resource</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A portion of a resource, pointed to as the precise	destination of a link. As one example, a link might specify that an entire	document be retrieved and displayed, but that some specific part(s) of it is the specific linked data, to be treated in an application-appropriate manner such as indication by highlighting, scrolling, etc.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-traversal" term="Traversal">traversal</termdef></label>
				<def><p>The action of using a <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>; that is, of accessing a <termref def="dt-resource">resource</termref>. Traversal may be initiated by a user action (for example, clicking on the displayed content of a <termref def="dt-linkel">linking element</termref>) or occur under pr">resource</termref> is typically provided by means of a Uniform Resource Identifier, or URI. XPointers can be used in conjunction with the URI structure, as fragment identifiers, to specify a more precise sub-resource. </p>
	<!-- Removed the discussion of queries from the previous paragraph, due to €ÿntention within the WG. bent -->
	<p>A locator generallys described in IETF RFCs <bibref ref="rfc1738"/> and <bibref ref="rfc1808"/>. As these RFCs state, the URI may include a trailing <emphependent on the data type of the indica>id<¯code> addressing mode.</p>

			<!-- fixed links to the XML recommendation - bent -->
			<item>
				<p>If the connector is "<code>#</code>", this signals an intent that the containing resource is to be fetched as a whole from the host that provides it, and that the XPointer processing to extract the sub-resource
				is to be performed on the client, that is to say on the same system where the linking element is recognized and processed.</p>
