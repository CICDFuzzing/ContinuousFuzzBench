		<head>Introduction</head>
		<p>This specification defines constructs that may be inserted into XML DTDs, schemas, and document instances to describe links between objects. A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>, as the term is used here, is an explicit relationship between two or more data objects or portions of data objects. This specification is concerned with the syntax used to assert link existence and describe link characteristics. Implicit (unasserted) relationships, for example that of one word to the next or that of a word in a text to its entry in an on-line dictionary are obviously important, but outside its scope.</p>
		<p>Links are asserted by <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-element">elements </xtermref> contained in <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-xml-doc">XML document instances</xtermref>. The simplest case is very like an HTML <code>A</code> link, and has these characteristics:
			<ulist>
				<item><p>The link is expressed at one of its ends (similar to the <code>A</code> element in some document)</p></item>
				<item><p>Users can only initiate travel from that end to the other</p></item>
				<item><p>The link's effect on windows, frames, go-back lists, stylesheets in use, and so on is mainly determined by browsers, not by the link itself. For example, traveral of <code>A</code> links normally replaces the current view, perhaps with a user option to open a new window.</p></item>
				<item><p>The link goes to only one destination (although a server may have great freedom in finding or dynamically creating that destination).</p></item>
			</ulist>
		</p>
		<p>While this set of characteristics is already very powerful and obviously has proven itself highly useful and effective, each of these assumptions also limits the range of hypertext functionality. The linking model defined here provides ways to create links that go beyond each of these specific characteristics, thus providing features previously available mostly in dedicated hypermedia systems.
		</p>

<div2>
	<head>Origin and Goals</head>
	<p>Following is a summary of the design principles governing XLink:
		<olist>
			<item><p>XLink must be straightforwardly usable over the Internet. </p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must be usable by a wide variety of link usage domains and clas</p></item>
			<item><p>XLinks must be human-readable and human-writable.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLinks may reside within or outside the documents in which the
			participating resources reside. </p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must represent the abstract structure and significance of links.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must be feasible to implement.</p></item>
			<item><p>XLink must be informed by knowledge of established hypermedia systems and standards.</p></item>
		</olist>
	</p>
</div2>
<!--Changed the list of requirements to reflect current XLink requirements
document. bent-->

<div2>
	<head>Relationship to Existing Standards</head>
	<p>Three standards have been especially influential:
		<ulist>
			<item><p><emph>HTML:</emph> Defines several SGML element types that represent links.</p></item>
			<item><p><emph>HyTime:</emph> Defines inline and out-of-line link structures and some semantic features, including traversal control and presentation of objects. <!--Changed from "placement of objects into a display or other space" -elm-->
			</p></item>
			<item><p><emph>Text Encoding Initiative Guidelines (TEI P3):</emph> Provides structures for creating links, aggregate objects, and link collections out of them.</p></item>
		</ulist>
	</p>
	<p>Many other linking systems have also informed this design, especially Dexter, FRESS, MicroCosm, and InterMedia.</p>
</div2>

<div2>
	<head>Terminology</head>
	<p>The following basic terms apply in this document. <!--<IMG
	SRC="local://./linkdiag.gif">(figure to be inserted)-->
		<glist>
			<gitem>
			<label><termdef id="dt-arc" term="Arc">arc</termdef></label>
			<def><p>A symbolic representation of traversal behavior in links, especially the direction, context and timing of traversal.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-eltree" term="Element Tree">element tree</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A representation of the relevant structure specified by the tags and attributes in an XML document, based on "groves" as defined in the ISO DSSSL standard. </p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-inline" term="In-Line Link">inline link</termdef></label>
				<def><p>Abstractly, a <termref def="dt-link">link</termref> which serves as one of its own <termref def="dt-resource">resources</termref>. Conntent of the linking element could be explicitly pointed to by means of a regular <termref def="dt-locator">locator</termref> in the same linking element, in which case the resource is considered <termref def="dt-remote-resource"> remote</termref>, not local.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-locator" term="Locator">locator</termdef> </label>
				<def><p>Data, provided as part of a link, which identifies a
				<termref def="dt-resource">resource</termref>.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-multidir" term="Multi-Directional Link">multidirectional link</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref> whose <termref def="dt-traversal"> traversal</termref> can be initiated from more than one of its <termref	def="dt-particip-resource"> participating resources</termref>. Note that being able to "go back" after following a one-directional link does not make the link multidirectional.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-outofline" term="Out-of-line Link">out-of-line link</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref> whose content does not serve as one of the link's <termref def="dt-particip-resource">participating resources </termref>. Such links 						presuppose a notion like <termref def="dt-xlg">extended link groups</termref>, which instruct application software where to look for links. Out-of-line links are generally required for supporting multidirectional <termref def="dt-traversal">traversal</termref> and for allowing read-only resources to have outgoing links.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-parsedq" term="Parsed">parsed</termdef></label> <def><p>In the context of link behavior, a parsed link is any link			whose content is transcluded into the document where the link originated. The	use of the term "parsed" directly refers to the concept in XML of a
				parsed entity.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-particip-resource" term="Participating Resource"> participating resource</termdef></label>
				<def><p>A <termref def="dt-resource">resource</termref> that belongs to a link. All resources are potential contributors to a link; participating	resources are the actual contributors to a particular link.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-remote-resource" term="Remote Resource">remote resource</termdef></label>
				<def><p>Any participating resource of a link that is pointed to with a locator. </p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-resource" term="Resource">resource</termdef></label>
				<def><p>In the abstract sense, an addressable unit of information or service that is participating in a <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>. Examples include files, images, documents, programs, and query results. Concretely, anything reachable by the use of a <termref def="dt-locator">locator</termref> in some <termref def="dt-linkel">linking	element</termref>. Note that this term and its definition are taken from the basic specifications governing the World Wide Web. <!--Joel notes: need link here. bent asks: A link?-->
				 </p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-subresource" term="sub-Resource">sub-resource</termdef></label> 			<def><p>A portion of a resource, pointed to as the precise	destination of a link. As one example, a link might specify that an entire	document be retrieved and displayed, but that some specific part(s) of it is the specific linked data, to be treated in an application-appropriate manner such as indication by highlighting, scrolling, etc.</p></def>
			</gitem>
			<gitem>
				<label><termdef id="dt-traversal" term="Traversal">traversal</termdef></label>
				<def><p>The action of using a <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>; that is, of accessing a <termref def="dt-resource">resource</termref>. Traversal may be initiated by a user action (for example, clicking on the displayed content of a <termref def="dt-linkel">linking element</termref>) or occur under program control.</p></dem the host that provides it, and that the XPointer processing to extract the sub-resource
				is to be performed on the client, that is to say on the same system where the linking element is recognized and processed.</p>
			</item>
			<item>
				<p>If the connector is "<code>|</code>", no intent is signaled as to what processing model is to be used to go about accessing the designated resource.</p>
			</item>

	</p>
	<p>Note that the definition of a URI includes an optional query component. </p>
	<p>In the case where the URI contains a query (to be interpreted by the server), information providers and authors of server software are urged to use queries as follows:

	<head>Link Recognition</head>
	<p>The existence of a <termref def="dt-link">link</termref> is asserted by a <termref def="dt-linkel">linking element</termref>. Linking elements must be recognized reliably by application software in order to w.w3.org/TR/wd-xlink/"
xlink:title="The Xlink Working Draft"&gt;The XLink Working Draft.&lt;/A&gt;</eg>
		<eg>&lt;xlink:simple href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wd-xlink/"
title="The XLink Working Draft"&gt;The XLink Working Draft&lt;/xlink:simple&gt;</eg>
	Any arbitrary element can be made into an XLink by using the <code>xlink:type</code> attribute. And, of course, the explicit XLink elements may be used, as well. This document will go on to describe the linking attributes that are associated with linking elements. It may be assumed by the reader that these attributes would require the <code>xlink</code> namespace prefix if they existed within an arbitrary element, or that they may be used directly if they exist within an explicit Xlink element.</p>
		<!-- heavily modified this section to accomodate namespace-aware link recognition - bent -->
</div1>

<!-- Rewrote this entire section. - bent -->
<div1>
	<head>Linking Attributes</head>
	<p>XLink has several attributes associated with the variety of links it may represent. These attributes define four main concepts: locators, arcs, behaviors, and semantics. <emph>Locators</emph> define where the actual resource is located. <emph>Arcs</emph> define the traversal of links. Where does the link come from? Where does it go to? All this information can be stored in the arc attributes. <emph>Behaviors</emph> define how the link is activated, and what the application should do with the resource being linked to. <emph>Semantics</emph> define useful information that the applicaribute must contain either a string in the form of a URI that defines the remote resource being linked to, a string containing a fragment identifier that links to a local resource, or a string containing a URI with a fragment identifier concacenated onto it.</p>
	</div2>

	<div2 id="link-arcs">
		<head>Arc Attributes</head>
		<p>Arcs contain two attributes, <code>from</code> and <code>to</code>. The <code>from</code> attribute may contain a string containing the content of a <code>role</code> attribute frome resource being linked to. The purpose of the <code>to</code> attribute is to define where this link traverses to.</p>
		<p>The application may use this information in a number of ways, especially in a complex hypertext system, but it is mainly useful in avior Attributes</head>
		<p>There are two attributes associated with behavior: <code>show</code> and <code>actuate</code>. The <code>show</code> attribute defines how the remote resource is to be revealed to the user. It has three options: <code>new</code>, <code>parsed</code>, and <code>replace</code>. The <code>new</code> option indicates that the remote resource should be shown in a new window (or other device context) without replacing the previous content. The <code>parsed</code> option, relating directly to the XML concept of a parsed entity, indicates that the content should be integrated into the document from which the link was actuated. The <code>replace</code> option is the one most commonly seen on the World Wide Web, where the document being linked from is entirely replaced by the object being linked to.</p>
		<p>The <code>actuate</code> attribute defines how the link is initiated. It has two options: <code>user</code> and <code>auto</code>. The <code>user</code> option indicates that the link mcode>, <code>arcs</code>, and <code>extended</code> links. These elements may be instantiated via element declarations from the XLink namespace, or they may be instantiated via attribute declarations from the XLink namespace. Both kinds of instantiation ard in that extended links are more often out-of-line than simple links.</p>

<div2 id="simple-links">
	<head>Simple Links</head>
	<p id="dt-simplelink"><termdef id="dt-simpleline" term="Simple Link"><term>Simple links</term> can be used for purposes that approximate the functionality of a basic HTML <code>A</code> link, but they can also support a limited amount of additional functionality. Simple links have only one locator and thus, for convenience, combine the functions of a linking element and a locator extended link:

<eg>&lt;xlink:extended role="address book" title="Ben's Address Book" showdefault="replace" actuatedefault="user"&gt; ... &lt;/xlink:extended&gt;</eg>

	And the second shows how the link might appear, using an arbitrary element:

<eg>&lt;foo xlink:type="extended" xlink:role="address book" xlink:title="Ben's Address Book" xlink:showdefault="replace" xlink:actuatedefault="user"&gt; ... &lt;/foo&gt;</eg>
