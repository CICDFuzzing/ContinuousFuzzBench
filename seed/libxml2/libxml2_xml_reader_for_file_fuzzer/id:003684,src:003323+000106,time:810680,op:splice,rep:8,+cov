This specification is concerned with the syntax used to assert link existence and describe link characteristics. Implicit (unasserted) relationships, for example that of one word to the next or that of a word in a text to its entry in an on-line dictionary are obviously important, but outside its scope.</p>
		<p>Links are asserted by <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-element">elements </xtermref> contained in <xtermref hrepertext functionality. The linking model defined here provides ways to create links that go beyond each of these specific characteristics, thus providing features previously available mostly in dedicated hypermedia systems.

<div2>
	<head>Notation</head>
	<p>The formal grammar for <termref def="dt-locator">locators</termref> is given using a simple Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) location, as described iling <emph>query</emph> (marked by a leading "<code>?</code>"), and be followed by a "<code>#</code>" and a <emph>fragment identifier</emph>, with the query interpreted by the host providing the indicated resource, and the interpretation of the fragment identifier dependent on the data type of the indicated resource.</p>
	<!--Is there some restriction on URNs having queries and/or fragment identifiers?  Since these RFCs don't mention URIs explicitly, should the wording here lead from URLs to URIs more expli associated with linking elements. It may be assumed by the reader that these attributes would require the <code>xlink</code> namespace prefix if they existed within an arbitrary element, or that they may be used directly if they exist within an explicit Xlink element.</p>
		<!-- heavily modified this section to accomodate namespace-aware link recognition - bent -->
</div1>

<!-- Rewrote this entire section. - bent -->
<div1>
	<head>Linking Attributes</head>
	<p>XLink has several attributes associated with d="link-behaviors">
		<head>Behavior Attributes</head>
		<p>There are two attributes associated with behavior: <code>show</code> and <code>actuate</code>. The <code>show</code> attribute defines how the remote resource is to be revealed to the user. It has three options: <code>new</code>, <code>parsed</code>, and <code>replace</code>. The <code>new</code> option indicates that the remote resource should be shown in a new window (or other device context) without replacing the previous content. The <code>parsption indicates that the link must be initiated by some sort of human-initiated selection, such as clicking on an HTML anchor. The <code>auto</code> option indicates that the link is automatically initiated when the application deems that the user has reached the link. It then follows the behavior set out in the <code>show</code> option.</p>
		<!-- Something should be put here in terms of an example. Idea: "A" link versus automatically updating encyclopedia. -bent -->
	</div2>

	<div2 id="link-semantics">
		<head>Semantic Attributes</head>
		<p>There are two attributes associated with semantics, <code>role</code> and <code>title</code>. The <code>role</code> attribute is a generic string used to describe the function of the link's content. For example, a poem might have a link with a <code>role="stanza"</code>. The <code>role</code> is also used as an identifier for the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> attributes of arcs.</p>
		<p>The <code>title</code> attribute is designed to provide human-readable text describing the link. It is very useful for those who have text-based applications, whether that be due to a constricted device that cannot display the link's content, or if it's being read by an application to a visually-impaired user, or if it's being used to create a table of links. The <code>title</code> attribute contains a simple, descriptive string.</p>
	</div2>
</div1>

<div1 id="linking-elements">
	<head>Linking Elements</head>
	<p>There are several kinds of linking elements in XLink: <code>simple</code> links, <code>locators</code>, <code>arcs</code>, and <code>extended</code> links. These elements may be instantiated via element declarations from the XLink namespace, or they may be instantiated via attribute declarations from the XLink namespace. Both kinds of instantiation are described in the definition of each linking element.</p>
	<p>The <code>simple</code> link is used to declare a link that approximates the functionality of the HTML <code>A</code> element. It has, however, a few added features to increase its value, including the potential declaration of semantics and behavior. The <code>locator</code> elements are used to define the resource being linked to. Some links may contain multiple locators, representing a choice of potential links to be traversed. The <code>arcs</code> are used to define the traversal semantics of the link. Finally, an <code>extended</code> linking element differs from a simple link in that it can connect any number of resources, not just one local resource (optionalexpressed by attributes on the link, the link's element type name, or in
	some other way, and are not considered full-fledged resources of the link.
	Most out-of-line links are extended links, as these have a far wider range
	of uses.</p>
</div2>

<div2 id="extended-link">
<head>Extended Links</head>
	<p><termdef id="dt-extendedlink" term="Extended Link">An <term>extended link</term> differs from a simple link in that it can connect any number of resources, not just one local resource (optionally) and one remote resource, and in that extended links are more often out-of-line than simple links.</termdef></p>
	<p>These additional capabilities of extended links are required for:  
		<ulist>
			<item>
				<p>Enabling outgoing links in documents that cannot be mo in this case, they are considered to define the default behavior for all the linking elements that they contain.</p>
	<p>However, when a linking element within an extended link has a <code>show</code> or <code>actuate</code> attribute of its own, that attribute overrides the defaults set on the extended linking element.</p>
	<p>The extended linking element itself retains those attributes relevant to the link as a whole, and to its local resource if any. Following are two sample declaration for an extended imple|extended|locator|arc) 	#FIXED "extended"
	xlink:role           CDATA    					#IMPLIED
	xlink:title          CDATA    					#IMPLIED
	xlink:showdefault    (new|parsed|replace)    	#IMPLIED 
    xlink:actuatedefault (user|auto) 				#IMPLIED &gt;</eg>

	The following two examples demonstrate how each of the above might appear within a document instance. Note that the content of these examples would be other elements. For brevity's sake, they'eft blank. The first example shows how the link might appear, using an explicit XLink extended link:

<eg>&lt;xlink:extended role="address book" title="Ben's Address Book" showdefault="replace" actuatedefault="user"&gt; ... &lt;/xlink:extended&gt;</eg>

	And the second shows how the link might appear, using an arbitrary element:

<eg>&lt;foo xlink:type="extended" xlink:role="address book" xlink:title="Ben's Address Book" xlink:showdefault="replace" xlink:actuatedefault="user"&gt; ... &lt;/foo&gt;</eg>
	</p>

</div2>

<div2 id="xlink-arcs">
	<head>Arc Elements</head>
	<p><termdef id="dt-arc" term="Arc">An <term>arc</term> is contained within an extended link for the purpose of defining traversal behavior.</termdef> More than one arc may be associated with a link. Otherwise, arc elements function exactly as the arc attributes might lead on to expect.</p>
	<!-- More here? -bent -->
</div2>

</div1>
<div1>
<head>Conformance</head>
<p>An element conforms to XLink if:  <olist>
<item><p>The element has an <code>xml:link</code> attribute whose value is
one of the attribute values prescribed by this specification, and</p></item>
<item><p>the element and all of its attributes and content adhere to the
syntactic
requirements imposed by the chosen <code>xml:link</code> attribute value,
as prescribed in this specification.</p></item>
</olist></p>
<p>Note that conformance is assessed at the level of individual elements,
rather than whole XML documents, because XLink and non-XLink linking mechanisms
may be used side by side in any one document.</p>
<p>An application conforms to XLink if it interprets XLink-conforming elements
according to all required semantics prescribed by this specification and,
for any optional semantics it chooses to support, supports them in the way
prescribed. <!--If/when we split out the XLinkfunctionality
