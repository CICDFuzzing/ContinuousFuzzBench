		<head>Introduction</head>
		<p>This specification defines constructs that may be inserted into XML DTDs, schemas, and document instances to describe links between objects. A <termref def="dt-link">link</termref>, as the term is xample that of one word to the next or that of a word in a text to its entry in an on-line dictionary are obviously important, but outside its scope.</p>
		<p>Links are asserted by <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-element">elements </xtermref> contained in <xtermref href="WD-xml-lang.html#dt-xml-doc">XML document instances</xtermref>. The simplest case is very like an HTML <code>A</code> link, and has these characteristics:
			<ulist>
				<item><p>The link is expressed at one of its ends (similar to the <code>A</code> element in some document)</p></item>
				<item><p>Users can only initiate travel from that end to the other</p></item>
				<item><p>The link's effect on windows, frames, go-back lists, stylesheets in use, and so on is mainly determined by browsers, not by the link itself. For example, traveral of <code>A</code> links normally replaces the current view, perhaps with a user option to open a new window.</p></item>
				<item><p>The link goes to only one destination (although a server may have great freedom in finding or dynamically creating that destination).</p></item>
			</ulist>
		</p>
		<p>While this set of characteristics is already very powerful and obviously has proven itself highly useful and effective, each of these assumptions also limitral SGML element types that represent links.</p></item>

	Any arbitrary element can be made into an XLink by using the <code>xlink:types><xnt> attribute. And, of course, the explicit XLink elements may be used, as well. This document will go on to describe the linking attributes that are associated with linking elements. It may be assumed by the reader that these attributes would require the <code>xlink</code> namespace prefix if they existed within an arbitrary element, or that they may be used directly if they exist within an explicit Xlink element.</p>

	<head>Linking Attributes</head>
	<p>XLink has several attributes associated with the variety of links it may represent. These aful to have an out-of-line simple link, although
	such links are uncommon. They are called "one-ended" and are typically used
	to associate discrete semantic properties with locations. The properties might
	be expressed by attributes on the link, the link'	<p><termdef id="dt-extendedlink" term="Extended Link">An <term>extended link</term> differs from a simple link in that it can connect any number of resources, not just one local resource (optionally) and one remote resource, and in that extended links are more often out-of-line than simple links.</termdef></p>
